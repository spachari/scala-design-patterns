Our type: Int.

Our associative operation: add. It is indeed associative because ((1 + 2) + 3) == (1 + (2 + 3)).

Our identity element: 0. It does nothing when added to another integer.

//Monoids are associative so they can be run in parallel

//Monoids support composition; if A and B are monoids, then their product (A, B) is also a monoid.
