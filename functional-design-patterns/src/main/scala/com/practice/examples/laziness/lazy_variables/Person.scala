  /*
  There is another way to implement lazy evaluations in Scala. It is through using anonymous functions and taking advantage
  of the fact that functions are a part of unifications in Scala and we can also pass them as parameters easily. This is done
  as followsâ€”a value is represented as () => value rather than just the value itself. It is somewhat pointless, though, especially
  because we already have two mechanisms that can do quite a lot. Using anonymous functions for a lazy evaluation is not recommended.

/*
the first version of our method retrieves the by-name parameter value twice, while the second version does it only once.

The fact that we use a lazy val inside the second method also has the possibility of not evaluating our expensive expression
at all if we don't actually use it.
