The actual implementation of the database service is in the nested H2DatabaseService class. Nothing special about it. But what about the DatabaseComponent
trait? It is simpleâ€”we want to have a database component that we will mix in our classes and it will provide functionality to connect to the databases.
The databaseService variable is left to be abstract and will have to be implemented when the component is mixed in.
